# Streakiness-in-Hockey
Conventional wisdom dictates that Hockey teams' recent performance is the best predictor of current success. This is why we see teams that get "hot" at the end of the season dominate the NHL playoffs rather than teams that were strong all season. This notebook will scrape game data from 2009-present from NHL reference, use simple exponentially smoothed stats as predictors for modeling win probability of the home team, and compare the models that used different smoothing constants (alpha) to determine how "streaky" teams are. The higher the most successful alpha values, the more impact recent games have on current success.
